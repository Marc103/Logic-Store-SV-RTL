8-bit address, 16-bit data, no FWFT

hits > 500 Mhz

The bottleneck is the logic depth of the full / almost full and empty / almost
empty flags. Best practice is to use a very shallow async fifo to perform 
CDC then connect the readside to a larger sync fifo. Could go as far as having
an asyn fifo with a 4-bit address purely for CDC. 

4-bit address hits 600 Mhz on highest speed grade.
